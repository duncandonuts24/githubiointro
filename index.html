    <h1>Duncan French</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Arlington, Virginia. I went to Washington-Liberty High School, where I was a member 
        of the ultimate frisbee team (the slarenegs) and the chess club. In my free time I like to 
        study chess, bake cookies, play frisbee, and play video games with my brothers. Some of my 
        favorite games to play are Civilization 6 and Minecraft, although we play Fortnite sometimes too.
        Some aspirations of mine are to become a titled chess player, make it to college frisbee nationals, 
        and to learn to make really good empanadas.
